# Chatbot-for-Mental-Health
By harnessing the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, the chatbot aims to simulate human-like interactions, fostering a sense of trust and understanding among users.

## Why do we need a chatbot for mental health?
The National Mental Health Survey reported that one in seven people in India suffered from mental disorders, including depression and anxiety.
Nearly 150 million people in India needed interventions, where the low and middle class faced more burden than the well-off people.
More and more mental health issues such as depression are getting known and recognized by our society today. 
This project is an attempt to make mental health more accessible. This conversational agent can be complemented with clinicians to make it more effective and fruitful.

## Overview of the Project
The user can type or speak their message. The chatbot replies to the user's message effectively and the user also has an option to send the conversation as an email to the desired person.
